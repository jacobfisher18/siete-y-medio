# siete-y-medio
An implementation of the famous card game in C++

## Rules
The goal of the game is to get cards whose total value comes the closest to 7 1/2 without going over it.
Getting a card total over 7 1/2 is called "busting".
The game is played with a 'Spanish baraja', a type of card deck.

From wikipedia:

> The traditional Spanish baraja is an old deck that was brought over by the Moors to Spain during the 14th century. The cards are still called naipes after the nā'ib cards found in the Mamluk deck...
